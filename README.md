- 3 new unleashable birds

# List of all Changes

## Additions

### Southern Villages

- At the start of each new playthrough 3 new southern medium sized villages will spawn in the desert
- Similar to northern villages, these will belong to the nearest city state, so making them angry will also, to a lesser degree, make their owners angry
- Each Village will contain two additional buildings:
	- Either a Weaponsmith or an Armorsmith
	- Either a Temple or a Barber
- Southern Villages offer a mix of southern city state contracts and northern village contracts

### Beast Caves

- Add Beasts Cave locations for most beasts with 140 Base Resources and a Visibility Multiplier of 0.6 (they are hard to naturally find)
- Caves always drop a random treasure and either drop a second treasure or some tools
- Caves may rarely contain named items (They follow the same Vanilla rule as all other camps for this)
- Every Cave will spawn a roaming party every 2 day. These parties will roam the around the cave for 1,5 day and then return to it
- The following Caves will appear from day 1+:
  - Direwolves Caves (Up to 3) spawn only in forests. Their roaming parties have a Visibility Multiplier of 0.5
  - Hyena Caves (Up to 3) spawn only in desert. Their roaming parties have a Visibility Multiplier of 0.5
  - Ghoul Caves (Up to 3) spawn only in swamps. Their roaming parties have a Visibility Multiplier of 0.5
  - Webknecht Caves (Up to 3) spawn only in non-snowy forests. Their roaming parties have a Visibility Multiplier of 0.5
- The following Caves will only start appearing at day 10+:
  - Serpent Caves (Up to 3) spawn only in the desert
  - Lindwurm Caves (Up to 2) spawn only in the desert or steppe
  - Unhold Caves (Up to 2) spawn only in the mountains or hills
  - Frost Unhold Caves (Up to 2) spawn only in the snow
  - Bog Unhold Caves (Up to 1) spawn only in the swamp
- Caves might be mentioned in tavern rumors but they will never be the target of contracts

### Craftable Items

- Forgetfulness Potion
  - Requires: Geist Tear, Shimmering Ashes
  - Consumable: Refund a random perk point
- Ayahuasca
  - Requires: Mysterious Herbs, 2x Poison Gland
  - Consumable: Increase your Perk Tier by 1

### Unleashable Birds

- Add 3 new unleashable birds, which are equipped in the Accessory slot, just like the Falcon
  - **Hawk** grants +15 Iniative and can be released to hinder an enemy movement for 1 turn. They are sold in T3 Towns, Military Settlements, or any town with a Hunters Cabin location
  - **Owl** grants +10 Ranged Defense and can be released to cause a negative morale check on an enemy. They are sold T3 Towns, Military Settlements, or any town with a Trapper location. Also regularly sold by Alchemists
  - **Vulture** grants +10 Threat (similar effect as direwolf pelts) and can be released to remove a single consumable corpse. They are sold T3 Towns, Military Settlements, or any town with a Pig Farm location. Also regularly sold by Alchemists

### Additional Artwork

- Add a new helmet variant for Witchhunter Hat, Undertaker's Hat and Dark Cowl
- Adjust Artwork for Duelist Hats to make them more distinct from Zweihander Helmets and Duelist Helmets

## Balance & Polishing

- **Falcon** no longer provides Initiative to your party when released. It now grants +15 Initiative while equipped
- All unleashable Birds (including Falcon) are now automatically released without effect when their owner takes any damage
- The Falcon now uses actual falcon noises when equipping or releasing, instead of using hawk noises

## Fixes

- Change witchhunter helmet icon to align with sprite

# Requirements

- Reforged

# Known Issues

- Geist Tear is not marked as a crafting ingredient even though it's now used in a recipe
- Peasants and Caravans spawned by City States appear at their Villages instead
- Southern Villages can sometimes spawn with additional northern buildings. That can happens if too few of those buildings were spawned

# Compatibility

- Can be added to any savegame (although the new southern villages will not appear then)
- Can **NOT** be removed from your playthrough
