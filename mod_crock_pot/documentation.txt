### Description ###

Write a short summary about what your mod does without going into specific. This text can then be copy&pasted and used whenever you publish the mod

### Future Plans: ###

- Improve Caves (Roamer, Tileset, Ambience, Alternative Location Sprites)
- Change auto release of birds to instead happen when owner loses morale?
- New Ammunition (ammunition rework)
- New Throwing Dagger weapon (3 AP attack, Dagger/Throwing hybrid, profits from between the ribs)
- change crock pot sounds into mono to reduce file size
- change bird sfx to mono to safe space
- Verify whether caves count towards beast fights. If not, make it so they do
- change events that grant falcon to alternatively also grant one of the other animals
