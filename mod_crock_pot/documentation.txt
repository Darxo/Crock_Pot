### Future Plans: ###

- Improve Caves (Roamer, Tileset, Ambience, Alternative Location Sprites)
- Change auto release of birds to instead happen when owner loses morale?
- New Ammunition (ammunition rework)
- New Throwing Dagger weapon (3 AP attack, Dagger/Throwing hybrid, profits from between the ribs)
- change crock pot sounds into mono to reduce file size
