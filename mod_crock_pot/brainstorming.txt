# Contracts

## Destroy Scouts
- Early-Mid Game contract (similar to follow the tracks)
- Goal is to find a nearby enemy party consisting of scouts, and killing everybody without letting anyone escape
- The nearby party will have a low visibility multiplier (optional: that will slowly grow back to 1.0)
	- They will spawn close to the town, have footprints coming from their location of origin
	- They will slowly return to their location of origin, producing footprints on the way back
	- When they return to that location, you fail the contract
- Enemy always starts in the center
- Player always starts in a circle around the center
- Enemies always try to leave the map, unless they are in zone of control
- This fight itself is safer than that of **Follow the Tracks** as you can choose yourself, how many enemies you want to entangle,
	- but the contract is be harder, because letting one escape will count as a failture. And if you want to win, you need to engage into multiple 1v1 or 1v2 scenarios
		- without the option to use spearwall, favourable terrain, or grinding enemy down over longer time
- A hard failure of the contract happens when you let more than half of the enemies escape
	- it is the same as all other contracts and
- A soft falure of the contract is harsher than with others
	- it is harsher than with other contracts: slightly negative relation or renown or both
	- happens when you let 1 escape or up to half of the enemies escape
- A win happens only when you let no one escape
- This contract is meant as:
	- an easy early game fight, where you can focus on killing some enemies and get some gear for the price of some renown/relation
	- a challenge/slightly different approachable fight: faster pace, forced split up of your party, many 1v1, open combat (good for dodge/scout)
- The enemy factions possible are:
	- Brigand, Goblins, Orcs, Barbarian, Nomads
	- Undead (a bit of a joke, as they only consist of slow-ass wiederganger)
	- Noble (during noble crisis or holy war), Southern (during holy war)
